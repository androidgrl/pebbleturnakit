## About

TurnaKit provides realtime directions during your bike ride and signals to traffic when you are about to turn for your safety.

It uses a Rails API to ping Google Maps for directions, then sends the data back to the Pebble app, which updates the directions for the user and activates the corresponding turn signals on the bike.  

This was built as part of the [Pebble Rocks Boulder Hackathon](http://pebblerocksboulder.com/) held at Galvanize Boulder from September 4 to 6.

More information about the project is available on [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/teamturing/turnakit).
